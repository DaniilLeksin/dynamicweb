application servers and databases.

Ungleich hosting let the user focus on being more productive, without having
to worry about the complexities of maintaining a production enviroment.

Brief summary of how it works:

1. The *User* goes to an Ungleich Hosting website to register.
2. Once logged in, the *User* get asked for his/her billing information to start
   booking machines.
3. After the *User* inserts a 'valid' credit card he books a VM.
4. When a VM is booked the *User* is subscribed to a 'plan' that it's related
   with the VM specs.
   a. User can be asked for a public SSH key, this key can be used to access
   to the server.
5. The subscription gets confirmed, *Ugleich* deploy the requested infrastructure
   and stack.
6. *User* is notified that the new VM is ready to use.
7. The *User* access the new VM and deploys the Application.

-----------------------
Ungleich Hosting - Goal
-----------------------

    As ungleich, we want to offer "Application Hosting" - pre-configured VMs plus
    support for the technologies running on them, the VMs should be "clickable"
    as in self service mid term.

--------------------------
Ungleich Hosting - Phase 0
--------------------------

This phase will deliver a fully functional webpage for railshosting, without the
capabilities of the 'ungleich hosting app', except from selecting an stack
ordering it by email and the user being subscribed to a plan (billing).

Where this phase come from:

    + ...for the moment, it is enough if we generate a mail for every order
    + get rails-hosting.ch running so that somebody can order a VM including
      payment

*********
Non Goals
*********

+ The VMs should be "clickable" as in self service.
+ End-User interface to manage their VMs.

*******************
The User Experience
*******************

We assume that the *User* (Masteen) has a Rails Application ready to deploy with our
current stack for RoR application.




--------------------------
Ungleich Hosting - Phase 1
--------------------------

This phase will deliver the foundations for most of the ungleich hosting app capabilities.


    for the moment, it is enough if we generate a mail for every order
